## Meeting policies

We have agreed to follow some meeting policies. The intent is to allow participants to feel comfortable with being candid and foster open collaboration.

### Chatham House Rule

We follow [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule) which essentially means:

> Its guiding spirit is: share the information you receive, but do not reveal the identity of who said it.

### No recordings, no transcriptions

Following somewhat from above in following Chatham House Rule, we prohibit taking screen or voice recordings. We also disallow any other means of taking transcriptions, such as AI bots.
