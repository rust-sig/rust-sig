# About Eclipse Special Interest Groups

Eclipse Special Interest Groups (SIGs) provide a flexible collaborative structure allowing Eclipse members to collaborate around a particular topic or domain within a broader working group. SIGs help bring like-minded working group members together to explore common interests within the scope of the working group. The goal of SIGs is to enable members to share expertise, discovery, best practices and thought leadership.

As an organizing model, and consistent with the working group process itself, SIG members can influence Eclipse projects by engaging in open source processes and/or becoming or supporting committers or contributors on existing projects within the purview of the working group.

* SIGs are collaborations of the willing
* SIGs are a space for thought leadership
* SIGs are open to community engagement

Like working groups, it is incumbent that:

* any working group member may join  
* agendas and minutes of all meetings be made public
* SIGs adhere to the policies of the Eclipse Foundation, including Antitrust, Intellectual Property, Code of Conduct, as outlined in working group charters and the [Working Group Process](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/industry_wg_process.php).
