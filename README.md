# Rust Special Interest Group (SIG) of the [Eclipse SDV WG](https://sdv.eclipse.org/)

In this group we hope to coordinate among interested commercial entities and open source projects on how best to use the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for Automotive applications.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a rising star among the programming languages used in embedded and mission-critical systems. In the July 2024 Tiobe Index, it leaped to a new record position, jumping from rank #17 to #13. In the automotive industry, Rust adoption has increased tremendously over recent years.

Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/) has a diverse ecosystem of open source libraries and tools supported by an active community; a real asset when developing open source software.

## Rust's usage in the Eclipse SDV WG

Within the Eclipse SDV, several projects are being written in Rust, e.g. [Eclipse Kuksa](https://github.com/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-databroker) and [Eclipse Ankaios](https://github.com/eclipse-ankaios/ankaios). 

Rust has strong potential to revolutionise the development of safety-certifiable open source software for automakers, suppliers, and start-ups.

## Rust SIG goals

This SIG aims to be a gathering location to:

* build consensus around reasonable and practical ways of using Rust in the Automotive industry
* share learnings and news to keep our community informed
* identify gaps for further improvement to make Rust hospitable to Automotive
* provide an "office hours" environment on our [Slack channel](https://sdvworkinggroup.slack.com/archives/C07A9DABC9M) and in our [bi-weekly meetings](./MEETINGS.md) if there are questions on how to use Rust in Automotive

See more details in our [mission statement](./MISSION-STATEMENT.md).

## Rust SIG's placement in the Eclipse SDV WG

The Rust SIG is a Special Interest Group under the Software Defined Vehicle Working Group.  For more information on joining and membership, please visit the [Rust SIG page](https://sdv.eclipse.org/special-interest-groups/rust/).

SDV Working Group SIGs operate as a non-governing body of the Working Group and inherit and adhere to the [SDV Working Group Charter](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/sdv-charter.php).  SIG goals must align with the goals of the Working Group.

See more details about Eclipse SIGs [here](./ECLIPSE-SIGS.md).

## Meetings

* [Meeting info](./MEETINGS.md)

## Leads

* Florian Gilcher ([@skade](https://github.com/skade)), Ferrous Systems GmbH

GitHub Team: [@rust-sig/wg-members](https://github.com/orgs/rust-sig/teams/wg-members)

## Materials

Special Interest Groups must produce agendas and minutes for all meetings. SIGs have the ability to create artifacts on behalf of the SIG but SIGs must not develop software, software documentation, or specifications as these formal artifact development belongs in Eclipse projects where project governance applies not in a SIG repository.
