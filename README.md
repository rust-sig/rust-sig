# Mission Statement and General Info
## Rationale
Within Eclipse SDV we see the first projects being written in Rust, e.g. SommR, a SOME/IP implementation, or Ankaios, a workload manager for edge and automotive systems, Eclipse uProtocol, a communication service mesh with key infra written in Rust, and Eclipse Zenoh, a low-latency communications framework.

The Eclipse SDV working group is fostering open source and technical innovation for the transition into the era of software-defined vehicles. We believe that a Special Interest Group for Rust will support its adoption and further strengthen the collaboration between automotive companies, cloud providers and the Rust community. 

Rust has the potential to become a foundational enabler for safety-certifiable open source software, the SiG aims to be in the center of that evolution.

The group focuses on work output first and foremost and is rooted in the practical projects Eclipse SDV implements.
## Scope
Initial focus areas of the Rust Special Interest Group are:
- Exchange experience and discuss opportunities and challenges around the adoption of Rust in the automotive and other safety-critical industries
- Engage in community outreach, knowledge exchange and acquisition
- Create and publish documents for practical guidance
- Advise and promote Rust-based SDV projects
- Promotion and potential future creation of open source tooling
- Collaboration with the Rust Foundation on the topic of safety Rust, particularly on coding guidelines
- Recommendations for changes for the upstream Rust project
